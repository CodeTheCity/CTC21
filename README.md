# CTC21
This is the home repository for [CTC21: Put Your City on the Map](https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/code-the-city-21-put-your-city-on-the-map/), which ran Saturday 28th Nov 2020 and Sunday 29th Nov 2020. 

On Saturday we had xx participants working on x challenges. On Sunday we had xx participants working on x challenges.

We used Zoom session to hold the space and alternated between main room where everyone should be together, and breakout rooms for group work in 90 minutes blocks of time. We then came back together to check in on how teams were getting on, and to share information and offers of help.

We will also use Slack and our Code the City workgroup as the back channel between rooms, and to coordinate the event outside of Zoom. This worked well in the run-up to the event, and also as the jumping off point for each day.
